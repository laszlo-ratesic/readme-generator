  ## 🛠️ Installation
  Locate the dropdown menu labeled 'Code' to the left of the About section in the main page of this repository. From there, select your preferred cloning method from HTTPS, SSH, or the GitHub CLI. For this demonstration, we will be using the SSH method. Copy the link and head to your terminal. From the command line you should enter:

  ```
  git clone <INSERT_SSH_KEY_HERE>
  ```

  Replacing the above placeholder with the link copied from GitHub. This will clone the repository into a local directory on your machine.

  From there, you need to install the dependencies using:

  ```
  npm install
  ```

   And that's it! Happy Hacking!

  ## 👨‍🏫 Usage

  [Link to the walkthrough video!](media/walkthrough.mp4)

  This code is strictly for use as a reppelant against the soul-sucking zombified non-life of doing things that are necessary, but ultimately boring and tedious, and is only provided as material for study and otherwise double-checking implementation of various NodeJS, ES6, and command line functionality. Any violations of these use cases will see the offender descended upon by a mob of angry latte-sipping hipsters, forced to attend an ayuhuasca-filled wannabe burning man festival every other year, while simultaneously being chastised by a nice-looking fellow who sort of resembles a young Bob Ross.
